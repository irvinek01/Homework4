# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
Web based quiz game. In this particular work, the questions are all about Javascsript programming with three choices each, the whole series is timed and can see the last play

- Many conditional statements firing then looping, to test what I learned from Week 2 (15 MAR - 19 MAR) 
- To help ease of thinking complex passwords by just the click of a button (And a series of pop up boxes)
- Learned array looping, getting values from different popup boxes (confirm, alert and prompt), using Boolean values to trigger functions and to turn them off, input validations checks(series of if else if conditional statements)
